Interactive Map

The Delphinus team will work on a web page with an interactive map to track the recycled materials from the trash bins to the final stops of manufacturing plants, where the recycled materials are processed into new products.
The goal is to provide easy access of the information about where the recycled materials go with internet technology, thus encourage people to recycle more.
To build such web page, it may require the following techniques:
	Front end:
HTML
JavaScript (may use framework like JQuery or  AngularJS)
CSS
Google Maps API
	Back end:
MySql
PHP
Itâ€™s estimated to 300 hours of work in total.
